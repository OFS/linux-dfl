This directory contains the dfl-config file which includes the config
options required to enable the Device Feature List (DFL) driver support.
By design the DFL driver collection is extendable and it is anticipated
that new drivers will be added to the collection.

The dfl related config options are intended to be appended to a base kernel
configuration. For example the following commands would modify an existing
kernel configuration to enable support DFL cards.

	# cd kernel_source_directory
	# cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
	# cat configs/dfl-config >> .config
	# make olddefconfig
