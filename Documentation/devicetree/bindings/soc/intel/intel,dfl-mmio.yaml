title: Device Feature List (DFL) for MMIO

maintainers:
  - Basheer Ahmed Muddebihal <basheer.ahmed.muddebihal@linux.intel.com>

description: |
  Device Feature List defines a linked list of feature headers within the device
  MMIO space to provide an extensible way of adding features. Please see the link
  for more information https://docs.kernel.org/fpga/dfl.html.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: intel,dfl-mmio

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      The 'reg' property within the node serves to define the memory-mapped
      address range for the DFL. The first value in the 'reg' property specifies
      the starting address of the DFL, and the second value represents the
      length of the address range from start address of the DFL.

  interrupt-parent:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      This property establishes a reference to the Interrupt Controller Node,
      which manages interrupts for the device.

  interrupt-user-start:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      This property defines the initial user interrupts available on the specified
      controller. GIC are reserved for local purposes

  fpga-interrupt-start:
    maxItems: 1
    descritpion:
      This property indicates the starting interrupt number within the GIC where
      FPGA-specific interrupts are mapped.

  fpga-interrupt-lines:
    maxItems: 1
    descritpions:
      This property specifies the total count of Interrupt Requests (IRQs)
      originating from the FPGA and routed to the GIC.
