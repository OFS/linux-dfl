Description:	The data sysfs file is used for firmware-fallback and for
		firmware uploads. Cat a firmware image to this sysfs file
		after you echo 1 to the loading sysfs file. When the firmware
		image write is complete, echo 0 to the loading sysfs file. This
		sequence will signal the completion of the firmware write and
		signal the lower-level driver that the firmware data is
		available.

Description:	The loading sysfs file is used for both firmware-fallback and
		for firmware uploads. Echo 1 onto the loading file to indicate
		you are writing a firmware file to the data sysfs node. Echo
		-1 onto this file to abort the data write or echo 0 onto this
		file to indicate that the write is complete. For firmware
		uploads, the zero value also triggers the transfer of the
		firmware data to the lower-level device driver.
