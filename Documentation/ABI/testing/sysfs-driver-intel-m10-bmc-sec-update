Description:	Read/Write. A key word from the available_fpga_images file
		may be written to this file to select the FPGA image to be
		configured on the next boot of the FPGA card. One or more
		additional keywords may be specified, separated by spaces,
		to identify a sequence of fall-back images in the event that
		the selected FPGA image fails to load. Reading this file
		will return the space separated list of keywords identifying
		the default power-on image and the current fall-back sequence.
		Your specific device may not support all possible fall-back
		sequences. The EINVAL error code will be returned if you
		attempt to select an unsupported image or fall-back sequence.
		Consult your product documentation for supported
		configurations.
