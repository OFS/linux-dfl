Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Read/Write. When read, the frequencies of both the low
		and high frequency clocks. These are displayed as two
		decimal values in units of KHz. The low frequency is
		listed first. The high clock frequency is generally 2x
		the low frequency, except that as the low clock exceeds
		300MHz, the high clock remains at 600MHz. When written,
		this file receives binary data containing the
		configuration parameters required to obtain the desired
		clock frequencies.
