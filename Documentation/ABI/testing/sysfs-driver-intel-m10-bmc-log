Description:	Read/write. This sysfs node controls the frequency (in
		seconds) that the host writes to the MAX10 BMC registers
		to synchronize the timestamp registers used for the BMC
		error log. Write zero to stop the timestamp synchronization.
		Write a non-zero integer value to restart or modify the
		update frequency. Reading from this file will return the
		same integer value.
		Format: "%u".
