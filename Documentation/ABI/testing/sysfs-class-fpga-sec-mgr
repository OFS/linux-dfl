What: 		/sys/class/fpga_sec_mgr/fpga_secX/update/filename
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:  5.12
Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Write only. Write the filename of an image
		file to this sysfs file to initiate a secure
		update. The file must have an appropriate header
		which, among other things, identifies the target
		for the update. This mechanism is used to update
		BMC images, BMC firmware, Static Region images,
		and Root Entry Hashes, and to cancel Code Signing
		Keys (CSK).

What: 		/sys/class/fpga_sec_mgr/fpga_secX/update/cancel
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:  5.12
Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Write-only. Write a "1" to this file to request
		that a current update be canceled. This request
		will be rejected (EBUSY) if the programming phase
		has already started or (ENODEV) if there is no
		update in progress.

What: 		/sys/class/fpga_sec_mgr/fpga_secX/update/status
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:  5.12
Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. Returns a string describing the current
		status of an update. The string will be one of the
		following: idle, reading, preparing, writing,
		programming. Userspace code can poll on this file,
		as it will be signaled by sysfs_notify() on each
		state change.

What: 		/sys/class/fpga_sec_mgr/fpga_secX/update/remaining_size
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:  5.12
Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. Returns the size of data that remains to
		be written to the secure update engine. The size
		value is initialized to the full size of the file
		image and the value is updated periodically during
		the "writing" phase of the update.
		Format: "%u".

What: 		/sys/class/fpga_sec_mgr/fpga_secX/update/error
Date:		January 2021
KernelVersion:  5.12
Contact:	Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. Returns a string describing the failure
		of a secure update. This string will be in the form
		of <STATUS>:<ERROR>, where <STATUS> will be one of
		the status strings described for the status sysfs
		file and <ERROR> will be one of the following:
		hw-error, timeout, user-abort, device-busy,
		invalid-file-size, read-write-error, flash-wearout,
		file-read-error.  The error sysfs file is only
		meaningful when the secure update engine is in the
		idle state. If this file is read while a secure
		update is in progress, then the read will fail with
		EBUSY.
