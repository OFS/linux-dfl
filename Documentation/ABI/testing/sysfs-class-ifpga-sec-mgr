Description:	Write only. Write the filename of an Intel image
		file to this sysfs file to initiate a secure
		update. The file must have an appropriate header

Description:	Read-only. Returns the size of data that remains to

		failure of a secure update. This string will be one
		of the following: operation-error, crc-error,
		auth-error, timeout-error, user-abort, device-busy,
		invalid_size. The error string is only accessible
		when the secure update engine is in the idle state.
